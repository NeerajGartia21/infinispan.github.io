    %p
      Also, if you are reporting a bug, have you checked our
      %a{:href => "http://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN"} bug tracker
      first?  It may be a known issue.

  %h2 Developers Mailing List
  %p
    This is a mailing list geared towards developing Infinispan itself.  It often contains deep, technical discussions on how Infinispan works internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot Infinispan.  Please use the User Forums for such questions.
  %p
    If, however, you are helping contribute to Infinispan, we welcome your thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
